	Subject: gre: raising the size of the buffer holding nl messages.

	Now it matches the size for the answer defined in rtnl_talk()
	and prevents stack corruption with answer > 1024 bytes.
	---
	FSL : The original commit is updated to include a change for grev6 as well.
	      The following two patches would also need to be bought in the future to 
	      prevent nl messages corruption problem in other cases. 
	      Currently these patches don't apply well directly on 4.0.0
